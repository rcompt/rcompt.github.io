## Bio

I spent my undergraduate career at Tucson, Arizona attending The University of Arizona. I began studying Physics but soon switched to Psychology. Through my research experience I gained an appreciation for Computer Science and started taking some programming courses from which I was hooked on programming. Ever since then I've been finding ways to incorporate the two into my research which is how I have found my way to University of California-Santa Cruz researching Human-Computer Interaction.

I am interested in how individual and social behavior can be explained by large scale data analysis. My thesis is centered on the study of the behaviors, interactions, influences, and changes that individuals of certain social roles go through in an online community. This encompasses four main areas of research.
