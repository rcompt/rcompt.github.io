## Bio

I spent my undergraduate career at the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona. I began studying Physics but soon switched to Psychology and Sociology. Through my research experience, I gained an appreciation for Computer Science and got hooked on programming. Ever since I've been incorporating the two into my research which is how I have found my way to University of California at Santa Cruz within the [Human-Computer Interaction Lab](https://people.ucsc.edu/~swhittak/Steve_Whittaker_Santa_Cruz_HCI/HCI_Lab_People.html) headed by [Steve Whittaker](https://people.ucsc.edu/~swhittak/Steve_Whittaker_Santa_Cruz_HCI/Steve_Whittaker.html).

I am interested in how individual and social behavior can be explained by large scale data analysis. My thesis is centered on the study of the behaviors, interactions, influences, and changes that individuals of certain social roles go through in an online community. I've studied a variety of community contexts in Health, Social, and Enterprise. My work encompasses a variety of Computational and Research methods, ranging from exerperiment design to graph theory and machine learning. The insights I find are intended to be incorporated into systems and application design focusing on improving the accessability and success for people. I aim to build systems through research and data-driven design focusing on improving the well-being and success of groups and individuals.
