## Recent Updates 

### July 2021
Submitted paper to [CSCW 2021](https://cscw.acm.org/2021/) on understanding small group interactions through graph substructures known as graphlets.

### March 2020
Began work as a Senior Data Scientist for [C3.ai](c3.ai) focusing on implementation of AI systems with actionable insights.

Short paper accepted to [AAAI-Make 2020](https://www.aaai-make.info/cfp/) on an algorithmic approach to explain abstract graphical embeddings.


## Research Goals

I'm a Data Scientist/Researcher focusing on how AI can understand and benefit people. My PhD thesis was centered on the study of the behaviors, interactions, influences, and changes that individuals of certain social roles go through in an online community. Iâ€™ve studied a variety of community contexts in Health, Social, and Enterprise. My work encompasses a variety of Computational and Research methods, ranging from experiment design to graph theory and machine learning. The insights I find are intended to be incorporated into systems and application design focusing on improving the accessibility and success for people. I aim to build systems through research and data-driven design focusing on improving the well-being and success of groups and individuals. I currently work as a Senior Data Scientist for [C3.ai](c3.ai) focusing on building scalable AI systems with actionable insights. I used to work at another startup (Quantiply) focusing on Explainable AI for Anti-Money Laundering systems and my PhD work was at the [Human Computer Interaction lab](https://people.ucsc.edu/~swhittak/Steve_Whittaker_Santa_Cruz_HCI/HCI_Lab_People.html) at UC-Santa Cruz led by Steve Whittaker.

I have a passion for understanding and building tools for people to achieve their success. AI can be harnessed for everyday people to grasp their own data and gain insights not possible. I aim to build systems to accomplish societal good, whether that be through fair and accountable AI or through acting as a processing tool through the ever growing amount of data for oneself. I believe one should have ownership of their own data and can be given the right tools to utilize it for their own good.

## Bio

I spent my undergraduate career at the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona. I began studying Physics but soon switched to Psychology and Sociology. Through my research experience, I gained an appreciation for Computer Science and got hooked on programming. Ever since I've been incorporating the two into my research which is how I found my way to University of California at Santa Cruz within the [Human-Computer Interaction Lab](https://people.ucsc.edu/~swhittak/Steve_Whittaker_Santa_Cruz_HCI/HCI_Lab_People.html) headed by [Steve Whittaker](https://people.ucsc.edu/~swhittak/Steve_Whittaker_Santa_Cruz_HCI/Steve_Whittaker.html).
