## Research Goals

I am interested in how individual and social behavior can be explained by large scale data analysis. My thesis is centered on the study of the behaviors, interactions, influences, and changes that individuals of certain social roles go through in an online community. Iâ€™ve studied a variety of community contexts in Health, Social, and Enterprise. My work encompasses a variety of Computational and Research methods, ranging from experiment design to graph theory and machine learning. The insights I find are intended to be incorporated into systems and application design focusing on improving the accessibility and success for people. I aim to build systems through research and data-driven design focusing on improving the well-being and success of groups and individuals. I worked for the past 5 years at the [Human Computer Interaction lab](https://people.ucsc.edu/~swhittak/Steve_Whittaker_Santa_Cruz_HCI/HCI_Lab_People.html) at UC-Santa Cruz led by Steve Whittaker.

Beyond my thesis work I have a passion for understanding [Social Complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_complexity). I began exploring such a phenomena when I was a research assistant in the Ethnology and Evolutionary Psychology Lab at the University of Arizona. The project I worked on examined motion of the human body and we looked to analyze through mathematical models like general systems theory. This exploration into how to map a system down to the many interactions of its parts captured my interest. I began experimenting with more complex social behavior through more simulation approaches, such as swarm models or multi-agent systems. I always look to incorporate these methods in understanding and designing future technologies, one instance being when I had the pleasure to work within the Stanford Crowd Research Collective led by Michael Bernstein and focused on developing a reputation system for the crowdsource system [Daemo](https://www.daemo.org/home).

## Bio

I spent my undergraduate career at the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona. I began studying Physics but soon switched to Psychology and Sociology. Through my research experience, I gained an appreciation for Computer Science and got hooked on programming. Ever since I've been incorporating the two into my research which is how I have found my way to University of California at Santa Cruz within the [Human-Computer Interaction Lab](https://people.ucsc.edu/~swhittak/Steve_Whittaker_Santa_Cruz_HCI/HCI_Lab_People.html) headed by [Steve Whittaker](https://people.ucsc.edu/~swhittak/Steve_Whittaker_Santa_Cruz_HCI/Steve_Whittaker.html).
