## Various Works and Essays

### [Manifest Destiny: Are Progressive Web Application Destined to Expand Across Our Online Experiences?](https://medium.com/ebaydesign/manifest-destiny-92cdace24869) Jan. 2018

This project was completed during my Summer '17 internship at eBay, Inc under the management of [Tony Topper](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonytopper/). We explored the incorporation of Progressive Web Application features inside a design experiment enviroment and how this changes the strategies of designing a better user experience. Three angles were explored, the implication to web app design practices, the user experience, and design research. 

### [Emotional Expressions in Online Settings: How I Spun Down a Data Mining Hole of Emotion](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~rcompton/Papers/Essays/EmotionalExpressionsinOnlineSettings.pdf) Mar. 2017

Emotional expression through text is a complex process. It can be expressed very explicitly through descriptive wording, "I feel happy", or be expressed through an implicit process "We are having cake!". This work was a class exploration budding from my work on explicit emotional expressing into examining a possible measurement of implicit emotional expression. 

### [Exploration Study of Retweet Propensity](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~rcompton/Papers/Essays/causalityRetweetPropensity.pdf) Dec. 2015

Causal explanations when working with pure observational data is a challange many Mathematical, Statiscal, and Computer Science researchers are focusing on improving. This work was a class project focusing on incorporating some known techniques of causal modeling toward an online media research question, what causes individuals to retweet on Twitter? 

### [Are Emotions Detected Differently within First-Person Narratives?](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~rcompton/Papers/Essays/AreEmotionsDetectedDifferently.pdf) Mar. 2015

Much of human expression is done through narratives. While much more on emotion detection within text has been through the lens of simplistic natural language processing techniques, very few have explore the overall structure of the text effects on emotional expression. This work was a class project examining how taking into the account Narrative vs. Non-narrative hierarchical information may be more predictive for emotion classification. 

### [Online Community Link Prediction with Collective Classification.](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~rcompton/Papers/Essays/OnlineCommunityLinkPredictionwithCollectiveClassification.pdf) Jun. 2014
Link predicition is a common problem for research on the Web. These links could be between two websites or two individuals. This work was a class project incorporating the unqiue relational feature set commonly used in collective classification frameworks, towards a task of predicting whether or not two online communities would hyperlink with each other.

### [Ranking Politicos.](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~rcompton/Papers/Essays/RankingPoliticos.pdf) Mar. 2014

[Ranking Politics](http://www.politicos.org.br/) is a Brailizian website going through the effort of information Brazilian voters about the quality of candidates running for office. A student group I was apart of for a class took the effort of designing a mobile interface for this website as the site itself was not mobile friendly (as of 2014). We incorporated many design research objectives such as Competitive Analysis, Personas, and Use Case research. We design low and high level prototypes and tested these with a small sample of Brazilian voters.  

### [ELO Outside of the Competitive Gaming Realm.](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~rcompton/Papers/Essays/ELO%20experiments.pdf) Mar. 2014
ELO was originally used as a chess ranking algorithm to quantatively measure skill. However the measure has found itself inside many more applications since. I used this algorithm to explore its ability in the YouTube slam competetion. 

## Fun Projects
### [ELO ability to predict baseball game outcomes.](https://github.com/rcompt/baseball-stats) Jan. 2016

Further explored ELO inside the realm of baseball. Used ELO as a prediction model to judge its accurancy on predictive baseball game outcomes. To little surprise this wasn't found to beat the odds in Vegas.  

### [Procedural Generation of 2D Caves](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~rcompton/game.html) Sep. 2014

Game development is a hobby interest of mine and I have many friends who work in games using [procedural generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation). I wanted to explore some basic generation techniques so I found one that used a common mathematical simulation ([Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)) to generate caves and implemented this within a web based enviroment.
