## Bio

When I was in academia, my research centered on the study of the behaviors, interactions, influences, and changes that individuals of certain social roles go through in an online community. Iâ€™ve studied a variety of community contexts in Health, Social, and Enterprise. My work encompassed a variety of Computational and Research methods, ranging from experiment design to graph theory and machine learning. The insights I find are intended to be incorporated into systems and application design focusing on improving the accessibility and success for people. This work was done during my PhD work in the [Human-Computer Interaction Lab](https://people.ucsc.edu/~swhittak/Steve_Whittaker_Santa_Cruz_HCI/HCI_Lab_People.html) led by [Steve Whittaker](https://people.ucsc.edu/~swhittak/Steve_Whittaker_Santa_Cruz_HCI/Steve_Whittaker.html).

Recently, I've shifted that focus to building robust machine learning tools through research and data-driven design focusing on improving the well-being and success of groups and individuals.
